# Cyclotomic-New-Points
All Sage code for our Algebraic Geometry project "New Points on Curves over Cyclotomic Fields". We used Galois theory and geometric methods to study a version of the Inverse Galois Problem for hyperelliptic and plane curves. A collaboration with Renee Bell, Kayla Gibson, Jack Valerio-Strauss, and Gesa Nestler.
