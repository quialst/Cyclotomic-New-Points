# Cyclotomic-New-Points
All Sage code for our Algebraic Geometry project "New Points on Curves over Cyclotomic Fields". We used Galois theory and geometric methods to study a version of the Inverse Galois Problem for hyperelliptic and plane curves. A collaboration with Renee Bell, Kayla Gibson, Jack Valerio-Strauss, and Gesa Nestler.

##Abstract

Let *C* be a curve defined by *f(x,y)=0* such that *f(x,y)* in the polynomial ring over the rationals. Faltings' theorem relates the amount of solutions to $C$ in the rationals to the genus of the curve. This invites one to consider the set of solutions over a finite extension of the rationals, and which field extensions give new points on the curve. Along these lines, Mazur and Rubin studied curves by understanding the field extensions of the rationals generated by a single point on that curve. We ask which field extensions arise this way, what their Galois groups can be, how many there are up to bounded complexity, and how this relates to the geometry of the curve. We explored these questions for different families of plane curves, using parameterization, Newton polygons, linear programming, SageMath, and Hilbert irreducibility.
