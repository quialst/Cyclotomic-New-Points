# Cyclotomic-New-Points

## Description
All Sage code for our Algebraic Geometry project "New Points on Plane Curves over Cyclotomic Fields." We used Galois theory and geometric methods to study a version of the Inverse Galois Problem for hyperelliptic and plane curves. A collaboration with Renee Bell, Kayla Gibson, Jack Valerio-Strauss, and Gesa Nestler. This project was done during the course of the Pomona Research in Mathematics Experience at Pomona College. Our group's research is still in progress.

## Layman's Explanation

An elliptic curve is a curve of the form *y^2 = x^3 + ax + b*. It was proved in the 1980s that there is a finite number of solutions to an elliptic curve which are rational (can be represented as a fraction of two integers). While there are a finite number of rational solutions, there is an infinite number of irrational solutions which cannot be represented as a fraction. One special property of the rational numbers is that they are a field. This in essense means that you can :heavy_plus_sign:, :heavy_minus_sign:, :heavy_multiplication_x:, :heavy_division_sign: any two rational numbers and get another rational number. We wanted to study what happens when you take an irrational solution to an elliptic curve and add it to the field of rational numbers and make a new larger field. This is called a field extension. What do these new fields look like? Are certain field extensions impossible? What if we use hyperelliptic curves? How does the geometry of the curve relate to which field extensions are possible? We used an object called a Galois group to classify and study these fields in a rigorous way.

## Abstract

Let $C$ be a curve defined by $f(x,y)=0$ such that $f(x,y)$ in the polynomial ring over the rationals. Faltings' theorem relates the amount of solutions to $C$ in the rationals to the genus of the curve. This invites one to consider the set of solutions over a finite extension of the rationals, and which field extensions give new points on the curve. Along these lines, Mazur and Rubin studied curves by understanding the field extensions of the rationals generated by a single point on that curve. We ask which field extensions arise this way, what their Galois groups can be, how many there are up to bounded complexity, and how this relates to the geometry of the curve. We explored these questions for different families of plane curves, using parameterization, Newton polygons, linear programming, SageMath, and Hilbert irreducibility.
